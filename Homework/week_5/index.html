      <h1>The Story</h1>
      <p1>In many countries clean and fresh water is still not avaliable to all.
        At the same time, obesity is spreading world wide as an epidemic.
       While 10 % of the children in Peru do not have access to clean water,
       almost the same number of children (aged 5 to 19) are overweight. As both these
       issues concern (mal)nutrition, I thought it would be fun to visualize
       these extremes. On the left you can see South America, defined by the
       accessablity of AT LEAST basic water drinking facilities. If you click on
       a country, a barchart will appear that shows the obesity rates of all the
       children in South America. Hovering over the map, the bar of that
       country will light up. Wait, there is more! You can also pick for what gender (or both)
       you would like to see the obesity rates. Note that all these data
       concern data gathered in 2015.
